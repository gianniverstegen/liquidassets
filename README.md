## Liquid Assets

A Java-based application for scraping large whiskey vendors to quickly query discounted whiskeys across multiple vendors. 
Currently, interaction is limited through the terminal. Querying is possible as the scraping process is ongoing.

### Current Features
- Scrapes data from multiple whiskey vendors.
- Implements a suffix trie for efficient name-based searching.
- Utilizes Javaâ€™s concurrency APIs for parallel scraping and querying.

### Future Plans
- Add comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure code reliability and maintainability.
- Either find an alternative to Selenium, or make the Selenium scraping more robust.
- Refactor prompt logic
- Enhance scraping algorithms to include more vendors and improve performance further.
- Implement a user-friendly interface for broader accessibility.
